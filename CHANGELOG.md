## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Founding decisions: domain glossary, ADRs, MVP scope, and the agent development process.
- `just` command surface: `check`, `unit`, `build`, `spike`, `fast`. The no-Arma gate
  (`just check` + `just unit`) runs in under a second.
- Pinned toolchain: HEMTT, `just`, Rust with `cargo-xwin` for the Windows shim, and a
  `uv`-managed Python environment.
- HEMTT addon skeleton, with the "no bare `random` or `sleep` in SQF" contract enforced as a
  `banned_commands` lint rather than a grep.
- Rust extension shim on `arma-rs`, round-tripping opaque payloads to the Python daemon over TCP
  loopback and returning replies through `ExtensionCallback`.
- Mission PBO packer (`tools/pack_pbo.py`), since HEMTT packs addons but not missions.
- Phase-0 spike harness and its measurements: `docs/spikes/0001-phase0.md`.
- ADR-0011: the acceptance-harness architecture — Python orchestrator, in-game gtest-style SQF
  asserts, verdict returned through the extension as structured JSON. Bohemia's `-autotest` and
  SQF-VM are rejected as test tiers, with reasons recorded.
- ADR-0012: the Command Port wire format — a domain protocol carried inside the daemon's
  transport envelope, not the envelope itself. The daemon judges Commands against the Funds
  ledger, one whitelisted server-side gateway admits the human UI, and every world effect rides
  the outbox for both Commanders. `CONTEXT.md` gains **Command**.
- Squads take **Orders**, and an Order is standing rather than a waypoint consumed and forgotten.
  A Commander tells one Squad to Capture an Objective, Defend one, or fall back into Reserve, and
  the three are distinct in the world: Capture searches the ground it is sent to, Defend goes
  there and stays, Reserve walks home and holds its fire. The Order outlives the leader who was
  carrying it — waypoints belong to the group, so the engine promotes a replacement and the Squad
  carries on — and a sweep re-asserts it once the engine considers the waypoint finished, so a
  Squad that chased a contact off its Objective goes back. Ordering a Capture on ground your own
  side already holds is refused with a reason rather than accepted as a no-op.
- A bought Squad gets an id its Commander can say out loud (`WEST-1`), counted up per side so a
  resumed campaign mints the same ids in the same order. The Purchase reply carries it, so a
  Squad can be ordered the moment it is bought.
- A player-led Squad is told its Order rather than made to follow it: the engine's own task
  framework puts it in the diary of whoever is in that group, with the ground as its destination.
  Compliance stays voluntary.
- `tools/port_demo.py` issues Orders as well as Purchases, and the Arma tier can boot the Phase-1
  world against `spike/phase1.cfg` with a one-off in-world probe appended to its harness.
- Objectives change hands by presence and pay income. A side alone in the capture radius takes an
  Objective after a held interval; both sides present makes it **Contested**, which is a real
  state that interrupts a capture, shows its own colour on the map and pays nobody. Every 60
  in-game seconds each side is paid the sum over the Objectives it owns plus a flat stipend, so no
  side can be economically locked out. The rules live in the daemon and are unit-tested there; the
  world only reports who is standing where.
- Income accrues in in-game seconds, so it stops when the Play Session does without anything
  having to know what a session is. A report arriving late still pays every tick it covers, and
  time stepping backwards is a mission restart rather than a refund.
- Command Port, in-world side: a single server-side gateway is the only function a client may
  `remoteExec`, with `CfgRemoteExec` locked to mode 1 on **both** `Functions` and `Commands` —
  a mission that locks only `Functions` leaves the whole scripting-command surface open. The
  gateway stamps the commanding side from the caller's own identity and overwrites whatever the
  client claimed. Accepted effects ride the outbox and a server-side pump applies them and
  acknowledges only what it carried out, so a failed effect is redelivered rather than lost.
- SQF speaks the Command format through constructors generated from the same Python source the
  daemon validates with, so the two cannot drift. `toJSON`/`fromJSON` (engine-native since 2.18)
  carry it, which means no hand-rolled JSON encoder and no escaping bugs.
- `tools/port_demo.py` issues Commands to a running daemon the way the AI Commander will.
- Command Port, daemon side: one schema source defines Commands and the effects they produce, the
  daemon is the sole validator, and a single entry function is the only thing that moves strategic
  state. Purchase spends Funds from a per-side ledger, queues its Squad-spawn effect on the outbox
  rather than returning it, and reports only the remaining balance. Insufficient Funds, an unknown
  Command, a malformed Command and commanding a side that is not yours are four distinct typed
  rejections — as against an unknown *transport* verb or an unparseable line, which stay errors.
- Squad prices, the starting balance and the stipend are authored in `config/economy.json`, so
  playtest tuning is an edit rather than a code change.
- Addon functions are declared in `CfgFunctions` and resolve by name as `cti_fnc_*` — from the
  mission, from `remoteExec` and from the addon itself. Verified on the dedicated server, which
  now loads the addon during the Arma tier.
- The Arma tier can drive a real player client end to end with nobody at the keyboard: it
  connects, takes a role and enters the mission by itself. `skipLobby = 1` does the work, because
  the server initialises its own mission before any client connects and there is therefore a
  running mission to be dropped into. No input injection, and no focus taken from other windows.
- Mechanical desync oracle for the open Windows-client desync (#8). The server samples every
  connected client's `networkInfo` and reports the worst reading over a window, so "a client stays
  responsive for a sustained period" is a number rather than a recollection. No client in the
  window is reported as `no_client`, never as steady. The Arma tier can also launch on engine
  defaults instead of the hand-written `basic.cfg`, which is candidate cause 2 on that issue.
- Stratis map manifest: eight Objectives with stable authored IDs, capture radii and an adjacency
  graph, plus both Bases and the HQ structure each would lose to Decapitation. Positions are the
  engine's own, read out of `CfgWorlds`, not eyeballed off the map. Authored once as JSON, read by
  Python directly and by SQF through a generated HashMap, so the two cannot drift.
- Manifests are validated before they can reach a Play Session: ID shape, capture radius, income,
  one Base per side, distinct HQ structures, and the adjacency graph the AI Commander will reason
  over — every edge mutual, every Objective reachable from a Base. A stale generated file fails
  `just check` as `schema_stale`.
- Phase-1 Stratis mission, thin per ADR-0007: two Commander slots, the named `HeadlessClient_F`
  slot, the two Base HQ structures, and nothing else. The addon builds the world from the
  manifest — every Objective marked with its owner, Neutral at boot, both Bases visible — and
  refuses to build at all rather than booting a half-built world.
- The Arma tier takes a mission, a server config and a log prefix, so it can boot the Phase-1
  world as well as the phase-0 spike. The Phase-1 server config keeps `localClient[]` to loopback:
  the LAN address the spike config carries there is candidate cause 1 on the open desync (#8).
- Real daemon (`cti-daemon`), replacing the phase-0 echo stub. Same transport the spike measured —
  newline-delimited JSON on TCP loopback, one connection reused across calls — with an envelope
  worth relying on: every request carries an id and every reply echoes it, and success, a
  domain-level rejection and an error are three outcomes the caller can tell apart. A malformed
  line costs one reply, never the connection.
- Acknowledged delivery for messages the daemon pushes to the game. Callback delivery is
  at-most-once across mission boundaries (ADR-0005), so the daemon holds each pushed message until
  the game acknowledges its sequence number and replays anything unacknowledged. Acknowledging
  twice is ordinary; acknowledging a sequence that was never issued is refused.
- Structured daemon telemetry as JSON lines, per request. Observability only, never read back as
  campaign state (ADR-0003) — which is why a failure to write it is swallowed rather than raised.
- Seeded PRNG adapter: the only sanctioned source of randomness in SQF. It wraps the engine's own
  `seed random x` rather than a hand-rolled generator, and hides both of that command's silent
  footguns — a seed truncated towards zero, and an upper bound that is included where plain
  `random`'s is excluded. A stream is `[seed, draw count]`, so it survives a snapshot and resumes
  where it left off. Determinism, both footguns, the integer range and serial independence are
  asserted against the live engine, not assumed.

### Changed

- ADR-0006 is now accepted unconditionally: the phase-0 contingency is discharged, and the ADR
  absorbs the spike's constraints (port range 2402–2406, missions as PBOs, no RPT file on a Linux
  server) plus a version-parity policy for when Arma 2.22 ships.
- ADR-0004 and ADR-0005 amended with measured constraints: the shim keeps one persistent TCP
  connection (~3× faster than per-call connects), and nothing in the Command Port may require
  sub-frame push latency, because `ExtensionCallback` is frame-bound at 8–17 ms.
- ADR-0004, ADR-0005 and ADR-0006 amended with engine limits found by cross-referencing phase 0
  against the full wiki snapshot: a `callExtension` return is capped at 10,240 bytes (chunking
  needed before snapshot save/load), a blocking call stalls the frame and warns at 1000 ms, the
  callback path drains at most 100 messages per frame and is at-most-once across mission
  boundaries, and 2.22 changes the extension error surface — prime `engine_drift` suspect on
  update.

- `just` command table in `CLAUDE.md` now lists the recipes that exist; the acceptance tiers are
  marked as Phase 1 work.
- *Read first* in `CLAUDE.md` now explains how to navigate the wiki snapshot: guessable paths,
  `MANIFEST.json` as the lookup, per-directory `INDEX.md` instead of listing a 2,672-file
  directory, and the two traps — categories live in the file header rather than the wikitext, and
  pre-Arma-3-only pages are excluded, so a miss is not proof the wiki lacks the page.
- Vendored snapshot of the Bohemia wiki (`docs/reference/arma-wiki/`), because the live wiki is
  unreachable from this project's environment and Arma 3 has been static at 2.20 for over a year.
  Now the whole wiki rather than nine hand-picked pages: 6,690 pages across scripting commands,
  functions, engine topics, class-name tables and the templates needed to read `{{RV}}` markup.
  Pages are bucketed by subject at predictable paths (`commands/setDamage.wiki`), each carries its
  categories in the header — they are template-generated, so grepping the wikitext finds none —
  and `MANIFEST.json` is the authoritative title-to-file lookup plus the redirect alias map.
- Lint-after-edit hook enabled for SQF, config and Rust edits — advisory only; `just check`
  remains the gate.
- The "no bare `random`" contract is now enforced by `tools/check_sqf_bans.py`, which allows the
  command in the seeded PRNG adapter and nowhere else. HEMTT's `banned_commands` lint is
  all-or-nothing and HEMTT 1.20.1 has no file-scoped suppression, so `random` is exempted there
  and re-banned here with the scope the contract actually wants. `sleep` and `uiSleep` stay banned
  by both.

### Removed

- Phase-0 stub daemon and its test. It echoed requests with timestamps and had no request
  identity, error vocabulary or delivery guarantees; the real daemon supersedes it.

### Fixed

- The shim's round-trip benchmark was timing requests the daemon never understood: it built its
  own payload, left over from when the daemon was an echo stub that accepted anything, and every
  spike run left about a hundred `malformed_request` records in telemetry. The payload now comes
  from the caller, which is also the shape ADR-0005 asks for — the shim has no business knowing
  what the daemon accepts.
- A headless client never entered the mission: its `HeadlessClient_F` slot had no `name`, and an
  unnamed slot is never assigned.
- The auto-format hook ran `rustfmt` at edition 2021 against an edition 2024 crate, so it wrote
  files that `cargo fmt --check` then rejected.
- The scoped SQF ban gate descended into nested agent worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/`,
  where every copy of the PRNG adapter fails the path-based allowlist, so `just check` broke in
  the main checkout whenever a worktree existed. `.claude` is now excluded; each worktree runs
  the gate on its own tree.
