# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Founding decisions: domain glossary, ADRs, MVP scope, and the agent development process.
- `just` command surface: `check`, `unit`, `build`, `spike`, `fast`. The no-Arma gate
  (`just check` + `just unit`) runs in under a second.
- Pinned toolchain: HEMTT, `just`, Rust with `cargo-xwin` for the Windows shim, and a
  `uv`-managed Python environment.
- HEMTT addon skeleton, with the "no bare `random` or `sleep` in SQF" contract enforced as a
  `banned_commands` lint rather than a grep.
- Rust extension shim on `arma-rs`, round-tripping opaque payloads to the Python daemon over TCP
  loopback and returning replies through `ExtensionCallback`.
- Mission PBO packer (`tools/pack_pbo.py`), since HEMTT packs addons but not missions.
- Phase-0 spike harness and its measurements: `docs/spikes/0001-phase0.md`.
- ADR-0011: the acceptance-harness architecture — Python orchestrator, in-game gtest-style SQF
  asserts, verdict returned through the extension as structured JSON. Bohemia's `-autotest` and
  SQF-VM are rejected as test tiers, with reasons recorded.

### Changed

- ADR-0006 is now accepted unconditionally: the phase-0 contingency is discharged, and the ADR
  absorbs the spike's constraints (port range 2402–2406, missions as PBOs, no RPT file on a Linux
  server) plus a version-parity policy for when Arma 2.22 ships.
- ADR-0004 and ADR-0005 amended with measured constraints: the shim keeps one persistent TCP
  connection (~3× faster than per-call connects), and nothing in the Command Port may require
  sub-frame push latency, because `ExtensionCallback` is frame-bound at 8–17 ms.

- `just` command table in `CLAUDE.md` now lists the recipes that exist; the acceptance tiers are
  marked as Phase 1 work.
- Vendored snapshot of the Bohemia wiki (`docs/reference/arma-wiki/`), because the live wiki is
  unreachable from this project's environment and Arma 3 has been static at 2.20 for over a year.
- Lint-after-edit hook enabled for SQF, config and Rust edits — advisory only; `just check`
  remains the gate.

### Fixed

- A headless client never entered the mission: its `HeadlessClient_F` slot had no `name`, and an
  unnamed slot is never assigned.
- The auto-format hook ran `rustfmt` at edition 2021 against an edition 2024 crate, so it wrote
  files that `cargo fmt --check` then rejected.
