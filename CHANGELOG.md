## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Founding decisions: domain glossary, ADRs, MVP scope, and the agent development process.
- `just` command surface: `check`, `unit`, `build`, `spike`, `fast`. The no-Arma gate
  (`just check` + `just unit`) runs in under a second.
- Pinned toolchain: HEMTT, `just`, Rust with `cargo-xwin` for the Windows shim, and a
  `uv`-managed Python environment.
- HEMTT addon skeleton, with the "no bare `random` or `sleep` in SQF" contract enforced as a
  `banned_commands` lint rather than a grep.
- Rust extension shim on `arma-rs`, round-tripping opaque payloads to the Python daemon over TCP
  loopback and returning replies through `ExtensionCallback`.
- Mission PBO packer (`tools/pack_pbo.py`), since HEMTT packs addons but not missions.
- Phase-0 spike harness and its measurements: `docs/spikes/0001-phase0.md`.
- ADR-0011: the acceptance-harness architecture — Python orchestrator, in-game gtest-style SQF
  asserts, verdict returned through the extension as structured JSON. Bohemia's `-autotest` and
  SQF-VM are rejected as test tiers, with reasons recorded.
- Addon functions are declared in `CfgFunctions` and resolve by name as `cti_fnc_*` — from the
  mission, from `remoteExec` and from the addon itself. Verified on the dedicated server, which
  now loads the addon during the Arma tier.
- Mechanical desync oracle for the open Windows-client desync (#8). The server samples every
  connected client's `networkInfo` and reports the worst reading over a window, so "a client stays
  responsive for a sustained period" is a number rather than a recollection. No client in the
  window is reported as `no_client`, never as steady. The Arma tier can also launch on engine
  defaults instead of the hand-written `basic.cfg`, which is candidate cause 2 on that issue.
- Stratis map manifest: eight Objectives with stable authored IDs, capture radii and an adjacency
  graph, plus both Bases and the HQ structure each would lose to Decapitation. Positions are the
  engine's own, read out of `CfgWorlds`, not eyeballed off the map. Authored once as JSON, read by
  Python directly and by SQF through a generated HashMap, so the two cannot drift.
- Manifests are validated before they can reach a Play Session: ID shape, capture radius, income,
  one Base per side, distinct HQ structures, and the adjacency graph the AI Commander will reason
  over — every edge mutual, every Objective reachable from a Base. A stale generated file fails
  `just check` as `schema_stale`.
- Phase-1 Stratis mission, thin per ADR-0007: two Commander slots, the named `HeadlessClient_F`
  slot, the two Base HQ structures, and nothing else. The addon builds the world from the
  manifest — every Objective marked with its owner, Neutral at boot, both Bases visible — and
  refuses to build at all rather than booting a half-built world.
- The Arma tier takes a mission, a server config and a log prefix, so it can boot the Phase-1
  world as well as the phase-0 spike. The Phase-1 server config keeps `localClient[]` to loopback:
  the LAN address the spike config carries there is candidate cause 1 on the open desync (#8).
- Real daemon (`cti-daemon`), replacing the phase-0 echo stub. Same transport the spike measured —
  newline-delimited JSON on TCP loopback, one connection reused across calls — with an envelope
  worth relying on: every request carries an id and every reply echoes it, and success, a
  domain-level rejection and an error are three outcomes the caller can tell apart. A malformed
  line costs one reply, never the connection.
- Acknowledged delivery for messages the daemon pushes to the game. Callback delivery is
  at-most-once across mission boundaries (ADR-0005), so the daemon holds each pushed message until
  the game acknowledges its sequence number and replays anything unacknowledged. Acknowledging
  twice is ordinary; acknowledging a sequence that was never issued is refused.
- Structured daemon telemetry as JSON lines, per request. Observability only, never read back as
  campaign state (ADR-0003) — which is why a failure to write it is swallowed rather than raised.
- Seeded PRNG adapter: the only sanctioned source of randomness in SQF. It wraps the engine's own
  `seed random x` rather than a hand-rolled generator, and hides both of that command's silent
  footguns — a seed truncated towards zero, and an upper bound that is included where plain
  `random`'s is excluded. A stream is `[seed, draw count]`, so it survives a snapshot and resumes
  where it left off. Determinism, both footguns, the integer range and serial independence are
  asserted against the live engine, not assumed.

### Changed

- ADR-0006 is now accepted unconditionally: the phase-0 contingency is discharged, and the ADR
  absorbs the spike's constraints (port range 2402–2406, missions as PBOs, no RPT file on a Linux
  server) plus a version-parity policy for when Arma 2.22 ships.
- ADR-0004 and ADR-0005 amended with measured constraints: the shim keeps one persistent TCP
  connection (~3× faster than per-call connects), and nothing in the Command Port may require
  sub-frame push latency, because `ExtensionCallback` is frame-bound at 8–17 ms.
- ADR-0004, ADR-0005 and ADR-0006 amended with engine limits found by cross-referencing phase 0
  against the full wiki snapshot: a `callExtension` return is capped at 10,240 bytes (chunking
  needed before snapshot save/load), a blocking call stalls the frame and warns at 1000 ms, the
  callback path drains at most 100 messages per frame and is at-most-once across mission
  boundaries, and 2.22 changes the extension error surface — prime `engine_drift` suspect on
  update.

- `just` command table in `CLAUDE.md` now lists the recipes that exist; the acceptance tiers are
  marked as Phase 1 work.
- *Read first* in `CLAUDE.md` now explains how to navigate the wiki snapshot: guessable paths,
  `MANIFEST.json` as the lookup, per-directory `INDEX.md` instead of listing a 2,672-file
  directory, and the two traps — categories live in the file header rather than the wikitext, and
  pre-Arma-3-only pages are excluded, so a miss is not proof the wiki lacks the page.
- Vendored snapshot of the Bohemia wiki (`docs/reference/arma-wiki/`), because the live wiki is
  unreachable from this project's environment and Arma 3 has been static at 2.20 for over a year.
  Now the whole wiki rather than nine hand-picked pages: 6,690 pages across scripting commands,
  functions, engine topics, class-name tables and the templates needed to read `{{RV}}` markup.
  Pages are bucketed by subject at predictable paths (`commands/setDamage.wiki`), each carries its
  categories in the header — they are template-generated, so grepping the wikitext finds none —
  and `MANIFEST.json` is the authoritative title-to-file lookup plus the redirect alias map.
- Lint-after-edit hook enabled for SQF, config and Rust edits — advisory only; `just check`
  remains the gate.
- The "no bare `random`" contract is now enforced by `tools/check_sqf_bans.py`, which allows the
  command in the seeded PRNG adapter and nowhere else. HEMTT's `banned_commands` lint is
  all-or-nothing and HEMTT 1.20.1 has no file-scoped suppression, so `random` is exempted there
  and re-banned here with the scope the contract actually wants. `sleep` and `uiSleep` stay banned
  by both.

### Removed

- Phase-0 stub daemon and its test. It echoed requests with timestamps and had no request
  identity, error vocabulary or delivery guarantees; the real daemon supersedes it.

### Fixed

- The shim's round-trip benchmark was timing requests the daemon never understood: it built its
  own payload, left over from when the daemon was an echo stub that accepted anything, and every
  spike run left about a hundred `malformed_request` records in telemetry. The payload now comes
  from the caller, which is also the shape ADR-0005 asks for — the shim has no business knowing
  what the daemon accepts.
- A headless client never entered the mission: its `HeadlessClient_F` slot had no `name`, and an
  unnamed slot is never assigned.
- The auto-format hook ran `rustfmt` at edition 2021 against an edition 2024 crate, so it wrote
  files that `cargo fmt --check` then rejected.
